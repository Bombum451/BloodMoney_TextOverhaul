a. the Terms of Service. This Part includes information about the terms upon

communicate with friends and strangers from across the globe by text and voice 
chat. The Service may also include community forums and other chat rooms. These

THIS DOCUMENT AND ALL TERMS, CONDITIONS, POLICIES AND NOTICES CONTAINED OR 
REFERRED TO IN IT IS AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND EIDOS RELATING TO PROVISION OF 
THE SERVICE AND THE ONLINE FEATURES (\"AGREEMENT\").  THE SERVICE AND ONLINE 
FEATURES ARE OFFERED TO YOU CONDITIONAL UPON YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF ALL OF THE 
TERMS, CONDITIONS, POLICIES AND NOTICES SET OUT OR REFERRED TO IN THIS DOCUMENT 
WITHOUT MODIFICATION.  BY COMPLETING THE ONLINE REGISTRATION PROCESS FOR THE 
SERVICE AND SELECTING \"ACCEPT\" BELOW YOU ARE AGREEING TO THIS AGREEMENT.
IF YOU DO NOT WISH TO BE BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT YOU SHOULD SELECT \" DECLINE\", 
CANCEL THE REGISTRATION PROCESS (WHERE YOU DO NOT ALREADY HAVE A VALID 
REGISTRATION FOR THE SERVICE) AND NEITHER USE THE SERVICE NOR ACCESS OR PLAY THE 
ONLINE FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE GAME.
A PRINTABLE COPY OF THIS AGREEMENT (INCLUDING OUR ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY) CAN BE 
FOUND AT http://www.eidos.com/online.html.  
A. Terms of Service
 
1. The Basics of the Service and Registration
 
1.1 Availability of the Service and Online Features is subject to you completing 
a registration for the Service and holding a valid UserID.  If you already have 
an existing UserID issued by Eidos or any of its affiliates in connection with 
the Service then you may be able to use that to access the Online Features 
associated with the Game subject to your acceptance of the terms and conditions 
of this Agreement as stated above. Not everyone is entitled to register for the 
Service. For example, registration for the Service may be subject to age 
restrictions applicable to you in your territory or by virtue of laws applicable 
to you in certain territories.  In particular we have special rules applicable 
to children and your attention is specifically drawn to paragraph 3 below and 
the provisions of the Eidos Online Privacy Policy for further information in 
this regard.
 
1.2 Once you have accepted this Agreement and have satisfactorily completed the 
online registration process by following the relevant instructions on-screen, 
you will be entitled to use the Service upon the terms and subject to the 
conditions in this Agreement.  Your registration is personal to you and may not 
be transferred.  Registration will entitle you to use the Service in order to 
play the Online Features of the Game only.  
 
1.2 As part of the registration process you will select a unique user name 
(\"UserID\")and password (\"UserPassword\").  You should choose a UserID which does 
not identify your real name.  Moreover, we strongly urge you not to choose a 
UserID which could possibly be used to identify you, your address, your age, 
postal/zip code, email address or telephone number.  You cannot use a UserID 
which is already allocated to another user and it is a condition of your rights 
to use the Service that you do not choose a UserID which is obscene or otherwise 
offensive.  We may but are not obliged to filter certain words and phrases which 
we consider unacceptable. However, whilst any registration process we may adopt 
may filter out certain unacceptable words and phrases it can never be a 
comprehensive filter.  We therefore reserve the right to terminate your 
registration for the Service (or otherwise require you to re-register with a new 
acceptable UserID) at a future date if, in our discretion, we consider your 
UserID or the use of it is offensive or otherwise breaches the terms of this 
Agreement in any way.
 
1.3 You warrant that all information provided to us during the registration 
process is true and accurate.
 
1.4 You agree not to allow anyone else to use your UserID and not to disclose 
your UserPassword to anyone else.  This is as much for your own protection as 
ours and other users.  However, you accept that you are solely responsible and 
liable for the activity carried out under your UserID on the Service and so if 
you do enable anyone else to use your UserID and/or UserPassword not only do you 
do so at your own risk  but you will also be in breach of this Agreement.  We 
may terminate your registration immediately for any breach of this agreement and 
in such event you will not be permitted to re-register without the express 
permission of Eidos.
 
1.5 Acceptance of this Agreement and registration does not give you the right to 
access and play all games which are made available via the Service nor does it 
entitle you to use or have access to any other service or website operated by 
Eidos or any of its international affiliates.  It may not be possible to play 
Online Features of any other Eidos games using your UserID. Separate 
registration for the Service may be required in order to play the Online 
Features associated with other Eidos games, or access to the Online Features 
which may otherwise be subject to eligibility criteria which you may not meet 
and acceptance of terms, conditions and restrictions which may or may not be the 
same as this Agreement.  In particular, access to certain services or specific 
games may be subject to:
 
(a) different or additional terms and conditions which require acceptance as a 
condition to access and play;
 
(b) a subscription charge or other payment; or
 
(c) age or other restrictions applicable to the game content as stipulated by 
us.
 
1.6 We reserve the right to reset your registration account at any time without 
notice to you in which case you may have to re-register under a different UserID 
and/or UserPassword in order to be able to continue to use the Service to play 
the Online Features.  Eidos accepts no liability of any nature whatsoever for 
any loss or damage suffered or incurred by you as a result of us resetting your 
registration account (including, but not limited to, loss of data).
 
1.7 You agree that all communications which you may make with other users whilst 
using the Service and the Online Features via chat rooms, community forums, 
message boards, voice chat or otherwise are public and not private 
communications and that you have no expectation of privacy concerning your use 
of the Service.  Moreover, you agree that you acquire no right, title or 
interest in any character, data, property or other matter which you may acquire, 
create or develop while playing a game in Online mode (including, but not 
limited to, game statistics, player results, league tables and your UserID).
 
2. Changes to the Service and Modifications to this Agreement
 
2.1 We may:
 
(a) change the Service; and/or
 
(b) makes changes to this Agreement
 
at any time. In addition, we do not make any guarantee that you will be able to 
continue to play all or any of the Online Features on the Service for any length 
of time. We reserve the right to withdraw any Online Features related to any 
game or games at any time.
 
2.2 Where we make a change to this Agreement such change will become effective 
thirty (30) days after posting the revised Agreement on the Service or other 
notification of such change to you by email or other means as set out below.  A 
copy of the latest version of this Agreement applicable to each Eidos game in 
respect of which on-line features are made available via the Service can always 
be found at http://www.eidos.com/online.html.  We therefore recommend that you 
regularly review the latest version of this Agreement.  If you continue to use 
the Service thirty (30) days after the date that the revised Agreement is posted 
on the Service (or website address referred to above) then you will be deemed to 
have accepted all such changes.  If you do not wish to accept or be bound by 
such changes, your exclusive remedy is to cancel your registration and stop 
using the Service before the end of such thirty (30) day period.  Cancellation 
may be effected by email to Community@eidos.com.
 
3. Children
 
WE ASK PARENTS AND LEGAL GUARDIANS OF CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 18 TO PAY 
SPECIAL ATTENTION TO THE ONLINE ACTIVITIES OF THEIR CHILDREN AND TO CAREFULLY 
READ THIS AGREEMENT. IN PARTICULAR, PARENTS AND GUARDIANS SHOULD SPECIFICALLY 
MAKE CHILDREN UNDER THEIR CARE AWARE OF THE RULES OF PLAY IN PART B AND THE 
IMPORTANT REMINDERS CONTAINED IN PART C BELOW. IT IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE 
PARENT OR GUARDIAN TO SUPERVISE THE USAGE BY MINORS OF THE SERVICE.
 
3.1 Neither the Service nor the Online Features of the Game are directed to 
children under the age of 13 and Eidos will not knowingly collect personally 
identifiable information from anyone under 13.  Further information concerning 
children and collection of information from children is contained in the Eidos 
Online Privacy Policy.
 
3.2 In addition, users under a particular age may be ineligible to play the 
Online Features associated with certain games which are subject to minimum age 
requirements stipulated by us.  The right to play any such game is subject to 
the user meeting such minimum age requirements as at the date of acceptance of 
this Agreement for the particular game.
 
3.3 No information should be submitted nor posted to or on the Service by anyone 
under the age of 13.  In such circumstances, where such children are 
nevertheless permitted to participate in any online activities, we may require 
written permission to be given by a parent or legal guardian in accordance with 
such procedures as may be stipulated by us from time to time on the Service as a 
condition to such children being able to participate in any online activities 
using the Service. 
 
3.4 All games published by Eidos carry a voluntary or mandatory age-rating 
identified on the packaging for the relevant game.  You should not allow players 
under the minimum age requirement specified in the applicable age rating for the 
game in your jurisdiction to play the game and by accessing the Online Features 
of a game you confirm that you and other players you allow to play such game 
have attained any such minimum age. Moreover, the content of the game may change 
due to interactive exchanges between players in the On-line mode.  Neither Eidos 
nor Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. accept any responsibility for content which 
is external to the game itself.
 
4. Technical Requirements
 
4.1 Your ability to access the Service and Online Features of Eidos games is 
dependent upon certain minimum technical requirements being met as prescribed by 
us from time to time for each particular game.  You are solely responsible for 
meeting the minimum technical requirements and paying for all connection fees to 
the Service.  Minimum technical requirements may vary from game to game and your 
use of the Service and access to Online Features associated with any game is 
subject to your technical and connection infrastructure meeting such minimum 
technical requirements.  We may modify the minimum technical requirements for 
use of the Service in relation to any one or more games at any time and without 
giving notice to you.

our discretion).

D. EIDOS ONLINE PRIVACY POLICY
 
Last updated 19 November 2004
 
PLEASE READ CAREFULLY
 
Scope and application of this Privacy Policy
 
Eidos Inc. (\"Eidos\" or \"we\") respects your privacy and is committed to 
protecting the personal information collected about you.  To further this 
commitment, we have adopted this Online Privacy Policy (\"Privacy Policy\") to 
guide how we collect, store and use any information you provide us through your 
Sony PlayStation(R)2 Computer Entertainment System in connection with and as a 
result of your use of the Eidos Online Game Service (\"Service\") to play the 
on-line gaming features of the \"Game\" and any other Eidos computer game made 
available on the Service where you are able to use your unique UserID to play 
the Online Features associated with any such other game.
 
This Privacy Policy only applies to the collection and use of information 
through your Sony PlayStation(R)2 console via our Service in relation to your 
use of the Online Features.  It does not apply to information which may be 
collected by Eidos or any of its affiliates otherwise than via the Service 
including offline or through any websites operated by Eidos or its international 
affiliates.  You are therefore encouraged to read the privacy policy applicable 
to the relevant game, website or service before you submit any personal 
information to it.
 
As a condition of your registration for and use of the Service you agree to be 
bound by the terms of this Privacy Policy (which agreement constitutes your 
consent to the use and processing of information in accordance with this Privacy 
Policy).  If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy you should not complete 
your registration for the Service nor otherwise use the Service in relation to 
the Game.
 
Eidos reserves the right to make changes to this Privacy Policy without giving 
prior notice to you. You should therefore periodically check that this Privacy 
Policy is the latest version by going to http://www.eidos.com/online.html where 
you will find a printable copy of the latest version of this Privacy Policy.  At 
the top of this Privacy Policy there will be a date when this Privacy Policy was 
last updated.  Your continued use of the Service will constitute your acceptance 
of any changes.
 
What information does Eidos collect?
 
In order to access the Service you need to create a registration account.  You 
will be asked for the following contact and other personal information: 
postal/ZIP code, gender, country of residence, email address and date of birth.
 
It is not possible to register for the Service without completing the mandatory 
fields which are specified during the registration process.
  
In addition, you will need to create your own unique UserID and UserPassword.  
Your UserID will be your nickname.  Your UserID and country of residence (as 
provided by you during the registration process) will be seen by other players 
using the Service in the following ways:
 
- when you log on to the Service;
 
- when you join an on-line game or participate in a lobby or community chat 
room;
 
- in league tables and other game statistics which may appear on the Service.
 
If you choose not to submit personal information when requested, you may not be 
able to participate in certain activities available through the Service and this 
may limit the services we can provide you.
 
As stated in the Terms of Service since your UserID and other communications 
made through your console are public and you shall have no expectation of 
privacy with respect thereto, we strongly urge you not to use your personal 
information when choosing a UserID or otherwise communicating with others on the 
Service.
 
The Service may allow you to chat with other users via voice communications or 
otherwise to attach graphics and other content. Again, all communications and 
attachments may be capable of  being viewed or heard by others using the 
Service.
 
We do not guarantee the security of, nor are we responsible for, any information 
posted on any in-game lobby room or other chat or community forum. Any such 
information could be collected by others.
 
We will also automatically collect such information as is necessary relating to 
your console to enable us to provide you with automatic software updates for 
your console and software patches for the Game.
 
We may collect and retain files of information concerning usage of the Service. 
We generate these entries anonymously.  They help us to determine (among other 
things) how many and how often users have accessed the Service, what games have 
been played, game scores and other in-game statistics.  We also use these 
entries for our own internal marketing and demographic studies, so we can 
constantly improve the services we provide to our customers.  
 
In addition, we may collect personal information from users when emails and 
other notices are sent to us.  
 
Billing information
 
Where we make a charge for the Service or any goods or services made available 
on the Service you will be required to open a billing account as a result of 
which it will be necessary to provide your name, billing address, credit or 
debit card number, expiry and other details, contact telephone numbers and date 
of birth.
 
How does Eidos use the information it collects from you?
 
Generally, information that we collect for a particular purpose is used for that 
purpose only. For example, information collected from you during your 
registration for the Service will be used to provide you with the benefits 
associated with such registration (e.g. to provide you with the features offered 
by the Service) including in the manner permitted under our Terms of Service.  
And, of course, credit card and other billing information is used solely to 
fulfil and process subscriptions and other purchase orders.  
Unless you have opted to consent to our use of your information for the purposes 
specified in the next paragraph below, your email address and other personal 
information will be retained and used only to the extent necessary to allow us 
to provide you with the features offered by the Service or to inform you of 
Service-related announcements or promotions (such as updates to our Terms of 
Service or Privacy Policy, new areas or features of the Service and technical 
support issues).  There are certain updates and messages concerning the Service 
that you will not be able to opt-out of receiving as they are part of the 
Service.
 
Subject to you having checked the appropriate box during the registration 
process indicating your consent to the relevant use and processing of your 
personal information we may use and process personal information collected via 
the Service for the purposes of:
 
(a) providing you with information concerning other products, services and 
promotions of Eidos and its affiliates.
 
(b) providing you with information concerning other products, services and 
promotions of preferred partners of Eidos and its affiliates.  In this case such 
information may also be provided by preferred partners to whom you have given 
your consent to your information being shared with.
 
If you no longer wish to receive information about any such other products, 
services or promotions of Eidos, its affiliates or preferred partners you may 
opt-out either by using the on-line form available at 
http://ww.eidos.com/online.html or by writing to the Eidos Community 
Administrator at the contact address given above.
 
Who is collecting your personal information and is it shared with anyone?
 
The information that you disclose through your console or computer and the 
Service is collected by Eidos or by a third party on Eidos' behalf and is used 
in accordance with the provisions of this Privacy Policy.  For example, the 
underlying technical architecture, infrastructure and support relating to the 
Service is provided by third party service providers.  All such third party 
service providers use your information for the purposes only of providing 
services on Eidos' behalf.
 
In addition, we may disclose personal information in the good faith belief that 
we are required to do so by law, including but not limited to disclosure to law 
enforcement or other government officials in connection with an investigation of 
fraud, intellectual property infringements, or other activity that is illegal or 
may expose you or Eidos to legal liability.  In addition, in the event of a 
merger, acquisition, reorganisation, bankruptcy or other similar event, Eidos' 
customer information may be transferred to our successor or assign, if permitted 
by and done in accordance with applicable law.
 
How can you access your personal information?
 
If you wish to review, update, or delete any personal information that we may 
have collected about you in the course of registering for the Service, please 
contact us by sending an email to Community@eidos.com.  However, you must be 
aware that, as outlined in this Privacy Policy, if you want to use the Service 
there is certain information which we need from you and we may not be able to 
provide the Service or certain features of it to you without it.  Moreover, it 
may not be technically possible to retrieve, locate, update or otherwise delete 
records of communications you may have posted on any forum, or in-game.  You 
should also be aware that if you change your email address it may not be 
possible for us to amend your existing registration, in which case in order to 
be able to use the Service you will need to re-register for the Service and you 
will unfortunately not be able to choose the same UserID.

Eidos will not knowingly collect or store any personal information such as names 
or email addresses from any children under 13 years of age and the Service is

box during the account registration process that we may share your information

preferred partners.  These partners may be located all over the world.
